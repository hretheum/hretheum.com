# Leadership & Philosophy

- Experienced in managing **tribe/chapter models** (Spotify-like orgs).  
- Skilled in **coaching designers into leads**.  
- Advocates for **designers coding and engaging with AI**.  
- Proven in **multidisciplinary collaboration** (business, IT, ops, product, data science).  
- Strong track record of **securing senior stakeholder buy-in**.  


## Product Design Leadership Playbook

As a design leader, my role is to establish not only outcomes, but also the systems and environments where design thrives.  
Below are the key principles, methods, and tools I apply when embedding Product Design and Research into organizations:

- **Org Models & Embedding**  
  - Tribe/Chapter (Spotify-style) models with embedded designers in squads.  
  - Dual reporting lines: craft leadership and squad delivery alignment.  
  - Clear interfaces between Design, Product, and Engineering.  

- **Discovery & Delivery Balance**  
  - Shift-left discovery: embed research upfront, validating assumptions early.  
  - Continuous discovery alongside agile delivery — research never stops.  
  - Establish discovery playbooks: IDIs, diary studies, JTBD interviews.  

- **Design Ops & Systems**  
  - Scalable design systems with governance: Figma libraries, tokens, accessibility baked in.  
  - Shared design language across teams, codified in Storybook and Git repos.  
  - Contribution models: squads feed back into the system.  

- **Research Ops**  
  - Centralized research repository (e.g. Aurelius, Dovetail) for collective knowledge.  
  - Standardized participant recruitment, incentives, templates.  
  - Democratization of research: enable PMs and engineers to observe and co-analyze.  

- **Quality & Feedback Loops**  
  - Regular design critiques and rituals.  
  - Review systems that raise the craft bar without slowing squads.  
  - Metrics for design quality: adoption, usability scores, support tickets.  

- **AI & Future-Forward Practice**  
  - Integrate AI-assisted design tools for faster prototyping and validation.  
  - Use LLMs to synthesize research findings, cluster insights, and propose hypotheses.  
  - Explore agentic AI systems to automate parts of the design ops workflow.  

Pull Quote:  
“Design leadership is about creating conditions where great design becomes inevitable.”  


## AI Builder Phase (2022–Now)
- Building **hireverse.app** → AI that interviews recruiters.  
- Created **personal RAG system** for design knowledge (n8n + Pinecone + TypeScript).  
- Developed **MCP server** for AI meeting intelligence (Notion ↔ Confluence).  
- Advocates: Senior designers should code, not just coordinate.

# Technical Recommendations — GTM, GA4 & SEO Integration

Below are the consolidated technical recommendations for integrating telemetry and metadata into hretheum.com (and similar projects).

## Goals
- Add ONE Google Tag Manager container (`GTM-PD9LCGMR`) for hretheum.com.  
- Integrate GA4 with a single Measurement ID (from the Web Data Stream).  
- Ensure correct `<head>` with SEO, Open Graph, Twitter, JSON-LD, canonical.  
- Add SPA-friendly pageview tracking on route change.  
- Add helpers for custom events (clicks, downloads, outbound links).  
- Add Consent Mode placeholders for future CMP.  
- Keep design/UI intact.

## 1) GTM integration

In the main HTML template (`index.html` or `_document.tsx`):

**HEAD:**
```html
<!-- Google Tag Manager -->
<script>
  (function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':
  new Date().getTime(),event:'gtm.js'});var f=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
  j=d.createElement(s),dl=l!='dataLayer'?'&l='+l:'';j.async=true;j.src=
  'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id='+i+dl;f.parentNode.insertBefore(j,f);
  })(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-PD9LCGMR');
</script>
```

**BODY (immediately after `<body>`):**
```html
<noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-PD9LCGMR"
height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe></noscript>
```

## 2) `<head>` SEO & social

```html

  "image":"https://hretheum.com/og/portrait.jpg",
  "sameAs":["https://www.linkedin.com/in/eofek"]
}
</script>
```

## 3) SPA pageviews (React Router example)

Create `src/lib/telemetry.ts`:

```ts
declare global { interface Window { dataLayer:any[]; } }

export const trackPageview = (path?:string) => {
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  window.dataLayer.push({
    event:"virtual_pageview",
    page_path: path || location.pathname + location.search
  });
};

export const trackEvent = (name:string, params:Record<string,any>={}) => {
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  window.dataLayer.push({
    event:name,
    ...params
  });
};
```

Hook into route changes:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";
import { trackPageview } from "./lib/telemetry";

export function RouteChangeTracker() {
  const location = useLocation();
  useEffect(() => {
    trackPageview(location.pathname + location.search);
  }, [location]);
  return null;
}
```

## 4) CTA instrumentation

```html
<a href="/apply" class="btn" data-gtm-event="apply_click" data-gtm-label="hero_cta">Apply Now</a>
<a href="/portfolio.pdf" class="btn" data-gtm-event="download_pdf" data-gtm-label="main_portfolio">Download PDF</a>
<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/eofek" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-gtm-event="outbound_click" data-gtm-label="linkedin">LinkedIn</a>
```

## 5) Consent mode (placeholder)

```html
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){window.dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('consent', 'default', {
    'ad_user_data':'denied',
    'ad_personalization':'denied',
    'ad_storage':'denied',
    'analytics_storage':'granted'
  });
</script>
```

## 6) Favicons & manifest

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/icons/favicon.svg">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/icons/favicon-32.png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/icons/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">
```

## ✅ After deploying
- GA4 → Admin → Data Streams → confirm data is flowing.  
- GTM → Ensure GA4 base tag uses Measurement ID (`G-XXXXXXX`).  
- In GA4 → use Explorations with **Page path** to check pageviews.  
- Test CTA clicks in Realtime using `data-gtm-event`.
